		&lt;h1&gt;History&lt;&#47;&#59;&lt;&#47;&#59;h1&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;Origin&lt;&#47;&#59;h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;The origin of cricket is unknown. There is a consensus of expert opinion that it was probably created during Saxon or Norman times by children living in the Weald, an area of dense woodlands and clearings in south&#45&#59;east England that lies across Kent and Sussex.There have been several speculations about the game's origins including some that it was created in France or Flanders. The earliest of these speculative references is dated Thursday, 10 March 1300 &#40&#59;Julian date&#41&#59; and concerns the future King Edward II playing at &ldquocreag and other games&ldquo in both Westminster and Newenden. It has been suggested that &ldquocreag&ldquo was an Olde English word for cricket but expert opinion is that it was an early spelling of &ldquocraic&ldquo, meaning &ldquofun and games in general&ldquo.It is generally believed that cricket survived as a children's game for many generations before it was increasingly taken up by adults around the beginning of the 17th century. Possibly cricket was derived from bowls, assuming bowls is the older sport, by the intervention of a batsman trying to stop the ball from reaching its target by hitting it away. Playing on sheep&#45&#59;grazed land or in clearings, the original implements may have been a matted lump of sheepâ€™s wool &#40&#59;or even a stone or a small lump of wood&#41&#59; as the ball&#59; a stick or a crook or another farm tool as the bat&#59; and a stool or a tree stump or a gate as the wicket.&lt;&#47;&#59;p&gt;
		&lt;h2&gt;First Definite Reference&lt;&#47;&#59;h2&gt;
		&lt;p&gt;A 1597 court case in England concerning an ownership dispute over a plot of common land in Guildford, Surrey mentions the game of creckett. A 59&#45&#59;year&#45&#59;old coroner, John Derrick, testified that he and his school friends had played creckett on the site fifty years earlier when they attended the Free School. Derrick's account proves beyond reasonable doubt that the game was being played in Surrey circa 1550, and is the earliest universally accepted reference to the game.&lt;&#47;&#59;p&gt;
